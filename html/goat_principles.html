	<p>Better. Human. Simple. Confident. Cohesive. Thoughtful.</p>

<div class="card subheader-card">
	<p>We have thoughtfully designed and strategically built Canopy to streamline and remove the tedious day-to-day busy work that plagues tax professionals. Tax professionals are human and they deserve simple, elegant and useful tools that allow them to be confident in the work they are doing.</p> 
	<p>Our mission is not only to help practitioners be more efficient, it’s also to build innovative tools that allow them to be the experts they are and elevate their own game.</p>

			<h3>Intentionally Better</h3>
			<p>We design Canopy to be intentionally better than our competitors by staying centered around our practioner’s goals and needs.</p>
			<p>We accomplish this through constant discovery of our practitioner’s needs and iterating as goals will change year after year. To provide the best tools we need to design the best tools.</p>

			<h3>Being Human</h3>
			<p>Canopy is designed and built by humans for humans and should always reflect that.</p>
			<p>The application should always communicate with our practitioners in a friendly, respectful, accomodating, and professional manner. Canopy should never feel robotic and technical.</p>

			<h3>Efficient and Delightful</h3>
			<p>Our goal is to provide an efficient, delightful application that helps our practioners be better at their jobs, it’s not only about getting things done.</p>
			<p>Making deliberate effort to constantly audit inefficiencies and make simple interface improvements as we go will delight our prationers and keep them engaged long term.</p>

			<h3>Build Confidence</h3>
			<p>We design and build an application for a highly educated and confident user base. Canopy should not make them feel any different.</p>
			<p>Like the tools of a skilled carpenter, our application should be simple, efficient, and always assume that our practioners know how to use it correctly. “Are you sure?” should never be in Canopy’s vocabulary.</p>

			<h3>Cohesive and Thoughtful</h3>
			<p>Canopy is should feel like one cohesive application that is thoughtfully crafted to function as one integrated, wholistic experience.</p>
			<p>While our application is built by many teams, those teams should always honor and remember that our practioners don’t experience just one feature at a time.</p>

			<h3>We Bear the Burden</h3>
			<p>The work practitioners do can be very complex. As the creators and builders of application, we actively look for ways to bear the burden of their complexity to ensure innovative, simple tools.</p>
			<p>Canopy should always be designed to alleviate complexity, it should never add complexity to the practioner’s journey. Our goal is to simplify
their experience.</p>
