	<h2>Design Quality</h2>
	<p>Preventing design debt and staying cohesive.</p>
</div>
<div class="card subheader-card">
	<p>To prevent design debt and maintain a cohesive, consistent user experience across all tools, services and features of our platform. Weâ€™ve designed a couple checklists to be used to insure that the design and experience is built and released complete. These checklists should not only apply to the design being assessed but also its integration into the existing application and surroundings.</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
	<h3>Checklists</h3>
	<p>The lists below should be used by the designer during creation of wireframes, mockups, and prototypes and should be reviewed before any design is handed off to engineering. Quality Assurance should also use the list after build to ensure the quality of design has been passed onto the production application. Any iterative changes made during the build phase should also be reviewed to maintain quality and mockups may also need to be updated to reflect them.</p>
