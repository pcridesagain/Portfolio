	<h3>Modals</h3>
	<p>Modals are small, focused transient container used for gathering user input or for interactions with a single call to action that does not navigate the user away from their current location. Modals always contain a footer and can have an optional header.</p>

	<h3>Guidelines</h3>
	<h4>Placement</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>L3 card should be used to contain content</li>
	<li>A 40% opacity Cool Gray (#52555A) <div class="color_chip cool_gray"></div> page mask should cover the entire browser below the card for focus</li>
	<li>A modal should be centered on the page</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Content</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Modals should have binary conclusions. <i>For example: Save or Cancel.</i> <b>If more actions are needed, please use an Overlay</b></li>
	<li>Modals should always have a footer containing a primary call to action and secondary call to action (usually cancel)</li>
	<li>Modal footer buttons should always placed on the left side of the modal container for better scanning and higher call to action visibility.</li>
	<li>The primary call to action should always be a full primary button, not a secondary, flat or tertiary</li>
	<li>Modal content can scroll, but header and footer should always be fixed.</li>
	<li>Modals should never ever ever ever link to another modal</li>
	<li>Clicking off the modal onto the mask should not close the modal, modals should be closed using the cancel or primary action</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Best Practices</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Instead of using a full primary and secondary button, we generally use a full primary with a flat button as the secondary action</li>
		<li>When using a modal to complete a form, the primary cta should be disabled until all required elements are completed</li>
		<li>Form validation in a modal can be used within the inputs itself or when using a scrolling form. Error text should be placed in the footer on the right side so user does not have to search for error</li>
		<li>If there is a lot of content needed, or more closing actions are needed (besides save and cancel), or multiple tasks are being used inside modal, or when there is no need for a primary cta - <b>please use an overlay</b></li>
	</ul>
