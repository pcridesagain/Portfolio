	<h2>Icons</h2>

<div class="card subheader-card">
	<p>Icons are used to visually communicate core parts of the product and available actions. They can act as wayfinding tools to help practitioners more easily understand where they are in the product, and common interaction patterns that are available.</p>
<h4>Icons can be used:</h4>
<ul>
<li>As buttons or actions</li>
<li>To give feedback of status </li>
<li>To improve the aesthetic of a list</li>
<li>To give an affordance for an interaction</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h4>APP ICONS</h4>
<p>	
Our app icons use reductive design principles, meaning all elements should be distilled down to their simplest form. App icons are used throughout the app to give affordance to an action, clarify content, simplify text, improve aesthetic of a list or to give user feedback.
</p>
<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Icons should be used sparingly, when text does not work. </li>
<li>Icon usage should be universal and understandable (i.e. trash can = delete)</li>
<li>App icons use the 24px square grid. Stick to the grid!</li>
<li>Every app icon should have at least 2px padding to contain the icon inside the 24px grid (therefore an icon’s maximum size should be 22px x 22px)
32px clickable area should be used, that is, 24px icon plus 8px margin. </li>
<li>Placing icons together: since icons are centered in the 24px grid with a 2px padding, icons can be placed right next to each or in 8px increments after that. Generally, 0px, 8px, 16px or 24px.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h4>ILLUSTRATIVE</h4> 
<p>The purpose of these illustration icon sets is to provide a small visual element to otherwise over explanatory/wordy views or to add another visual touch to content headers. Use these icons sparingly. </p>
<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Illustrative icons should never be used as replacements for app icons or navigational elements.</li>
<li>A 48px clickable area should be used for illustrative icons </li>
<li>Illustrative icons use the 48px square grid. Stick to the grid!</li>
</ul>
