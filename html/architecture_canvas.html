	<h2>Canvas</h2>
	<p>Every great piece of art starts with a canvas.</p>

	<p>Great interfaces feel like extensions of human interaction. We want Canopy to be simple, efficient and delightful, to accomplish this present content and information to the user in a natural and intuitive feel.</p>
	<p>Using principles of depth and hierarchy, we have created a more tactile and intuitive interface that mimics the world we know and respect - reading a book or tapping an elevator button.</p>

	<h3>The Canvas</h3>
	<p>Every element that is presented to the user is laid out overtop of <i>the canvas</i>. This is simply a base layer that ensures that the elements that are laid on top have a strong content hierarchy and contrast. It draws the users eye to the most important elements of the application.</p>

	<h3>Canvas Regions</h3>
	<p>Different regions of the canvas have consistently carried different purposes as Canopy has been developed. We've outlined a few of the patterns that are used to help define this consistency.</p>
